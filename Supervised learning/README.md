# 🤖 Supervised Learning – Meme Edition

> *“Why have one model when you can have an entire ML universe?”*  

Welcome to the **Supervised Learning** section of this repo — a full ML zoo where each algorithm has its own personality, drama, and deployment story.  

Here you’ll find:

- ✅ End-to-end ML projects (training → evaluation → deployment)
- ✅ Flask web apps + Render cloud deployments
- ✅ Clean pipelines, pickled models, and real-world datasets
- ✅ A lot of love for classic algorithms 💙
